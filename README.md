# [Useless Utilities] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Kevin]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Kevin B Kothat] - [SOE, CUSAT]

### Project Description
[Its an interactive web story about my experience with "AI" in this hackathon.
But in actuality its a cover to make my actual boring stuff seem interesting.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[I wanted to make people feel something when they see my project, so that was my problem - making people something through a website.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[I made a website that tells a story while also making you a part of the story, as you human feelings are easily swayed with stories.
And i already had some idead so i somehow made them into a somewhat cohesive storyline]
